# This project allows users to create a customizable API that chains different APIs together and returns the result from a 
# single API. By doing so, inputs from a user can generate outputs from another API that would normally not take those inputs.
# An example of this would be if a user wanted to check the weather using an IP address. With this user-created API, the IP 
# address could be used to find the location of the IP address and determine the weather with a location input.
